<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>This project consists of a very simple, server-side Swift application based on Kitura that supports an AngularJS client application that loads data from the Kitura backend and displays the data in a browser-based user interface.</p>

<p>The application performs a very simple service of getting and setting timestamps. The service routes are defined in main.swift on the server and can be consumed by any clientâ€”iOS or Android applications, web client, etc. In the case of this sample, the timestamp services are consumed via REST calls made from an AngularJS client service.</p>
